Large Description Documents
===========================

To assist working with large description documents it is possible to limit the models build to the minimum required.
This "minimum required" by the requirements of the Operations.

Currently there are two Plugins to assist such reduction - :class:`aiopenapi3.extra.Reduce` and :class:`aiopenapi3.extra.Cull`.
Cull is faster, Reduce assists in debugging.

Large description documents which are autogenerated by converting other service description document formats -such as odata-
may benefit from additional changes to the description document to eliminate conversion artifacts depending on the converter used.

As an example for additional steps based on the `Microsoft Graph API <https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-metadata>`_ refer to :aioai3:ref:`tests.extra_test.MSGraph`.
